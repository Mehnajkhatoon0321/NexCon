We offer abstract submission with customizable submission forms and file uploads. Our submission form allows the entry of proposal type, keywords, topics, preferred sessions, authors, and presenters. The system facilitates the review of abstracts and full papers, and sends system-generated emails to participants upon acceptance or rejection of their papers, along with remarks provided by the reviewers.\n\n'

As a conference organizer, you can manage multiple conferences through a single organizer account.\n\n'
